## Data Management

Key concepts to consider from [^1]:
* Data Ownership
* Data Collections
* Data Storage
* Data Protection
* Data Retention
* Data Analysis
* Data Sharing
* Data Reporting

[^1]: I got this printed document linking to a website which does not exist anymore.
    They claim it follows (Steneck 2004), probably the earlier version of [(Steneck 2007)](https://ori.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/rcrintro.pdf).
    Of this version, I can only find the revised 2007 version and not the 2004er version.
    If you can, drop me a message, thanks! :)

## Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN)

Not really wide-spread.
Could make things better (or worse).
Probably depending on the use case.

* An [open-source ELN](https://www.elabftw.net/)
* A [searched-for review site, nothing specific](https://splice-bio.com/the-7-best-electronic-lab-notebooks-eln-for-your-research/)
* [Labfolder, a proprietary and commercial solution they use in the Max-Planck research instutitions](https://www.labfolder.com)
* [Nature also had a piece on this](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05895-3)

## Nice stuff

The Office of Research Integrety (ORI) of the US Dept. of Health & Human Services produced this nice publication:
[Introduction to the Responsible Conductof Research by Nicholas H. Steneck (2007)](https://ori.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/rcrintro.pdf);
content-wise, the illustrations are a great summary regarding the various subtopics.
